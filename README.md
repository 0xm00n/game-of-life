# Game of Life

*in progress* :)

A high-performance C++23 implementation of Conway's Game of Life exploring emergence, complexity, and self-replication. 
Features include multi-scale visualization with Vulkan, GPU-accelerated simulation, Rule 110, and meta-cellular automata (Game of Life simulating itself).

This project is for refreshing my C++ skills and also exploring cool Game of Life visualizations, eventually towards meta-cellular automata.
